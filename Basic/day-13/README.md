## Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
### const and let
* When using **var** you can re-assign your variable. So, you could be creating two variables with the same name twice without knowing it. **let** doesn't permit that if you are in the same block. use **const** to specify the variable isn't going to be changed.

### Arrow Functions
* more compact that regular functions

### Default Parameters
* With default parameters, we can add default values to parameters

### Template Strings
* make strings dynamic

### Imports & Exports
* It is more useful in React. Named and Default imports

### Spread & Rest
* **Spread** syntax allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs are expected.
* The **rest parameter** syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, providing a way to represent variable functions in JS

### Array Destructuring
* It allows unpack values from arrays into distinct variables

### Object Destructuring
* It allows unpack properties from objects into distinct variables
